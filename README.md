# Real Time Collaborative Editor

Code editor, includes collaboration of over 50 people, and real-time updates. Unique feature: collaborative debugging.


## Todo

### Initialization
- [X] Initial Commit
- [X] PostgreSQL/DB setup with Prisma (vercel prisma serverless postgres)


### Infrastructure
- [X] npm install socket.io socket.io-client @types/socket.io
- [X] Socket.io Server custom Next API route in pages/api/socket.io
- [X] Socket.io connection in React hook

#### Update: used SSE server not socket.io, socket causes problems on vercel serverless

- [X] Set up SSE Next API route
- [X] React hook set up for SSE server

### OT / CRDT
- [X] Choose libraries like sharedb, yjs, ot.js
- [X] Install chosen library: npm install yjs y-websocket (if using Yjs)
- [X] Create doc synchronization logic

### Editor Component
- [X] Choose editor library: Monaco Editor, CodeMirror, or Quill
- [X] Install: npm install @monaco-editor/react (if using Monaco)
- [X] Create reusable editor component with TypeScript support
- [X] Implement basic text editing functionality

### Real-time Collab
- [X] Connect editor to your OT/CRDT system
- [X] Implement user cursors and selections visualization
- [X] Add user presence indicators (who's currently editing)
- [X] Handle user join/leave events

### Debug Session Management
- [ ] Create debug room joining/leaving functionality
- [ ] Add debug session permissions (who can control execution)
- [ ] Implement debug session history and replay features
- [ ] Handle debug session cleanup and state management

### Advanced Debugging Features
- [ ] Add collaborative step-through debugging controls
- [ ] Implement shared conditional breakpoints
- [ ] Create multi-user debugging annotations and comments
- [ ] Add debugging session recording and playback

### Build Core UI Components

- [ ] Design document dashboard using Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Create document sharing modal and user management
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling throughout

### Add Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement document export (PDF, Word, etc.)
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting for code documents
- [ ] Create commenting and suggestion system
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features


### Write Tests

- [ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library

- [ ] Monitor and optimize bundle size


### Vercel db setup

- [ ] Set up Vercel Postgres database (or Supabase for free tier)
- [ ] Configure connection strings and environment variables
- [ ] Set up database migrations for production
- [ ] Test database connectivity from Vercel functions


### WebSocket Infrastructure

- [ ] Research Vercel-compatible WebSocket solutions (Pusher, Ably, or Socket.io with external hosting)
- [ ] Set up Pusher or Ably for real-time communication (free tier available)
- [ ] Integrate chosen service with your collaborative editor
- [ ] Configure presence channels for user indicators

### Environment & Security

- [ ] Configure Vercel environment variables for production
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers in next.config.js
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API routes
- [ ] Configure security headers and CSP

### Vercel Deployment Setup
